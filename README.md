![Signals for TSLA stock](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4b153db-20ca-42ff-ab60-41d66f52f115)
A python tool for computing technical indicators from scratch and generating hypothetical buy/sell signals using popular technical analysis metrics among traders 

## Overview 
This project is an implementation of the following steps :
- Import a stock/coin data from a local csv file that should contain **Date,Open,High,Low,Close**
- Calculate 5 key technical indicators (ADX, SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, RSI)
- Visualize the price along with the indicators:

- Placing the signals :

      **Note**:ðŸš¨ I implemented all of this just for edducational puspose and these signals should never be considered as financial advice.
